"""This module provides an interface to TC4820 temperature controllers.

Decimal numbers are used for values sent to and read from the device as the values are
base-10 and using floats could cause rounding errors.

There are broadly two serial-related exceptions that are raised by this module.
MalformedMessageErrors are raised when a message is corrupted and are recoverable (i.e.
you can try submitting the request again). serial.SerialExceptions indicate that an
IO error occurred while communicating with the device (e.g. because a USB cable has
become disconnected) and are unlikely to be recoverable. A SerialException is also
raised if multiple attempts at a request have failed.
