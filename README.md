# FINESSE

FINESSE is software for controlling a spectrometer system developed by Imperial College
London's [Space and Atmospheric Physics group], written in Python and with a graphical
interface using the [PySide6 Qt bindings].

Emissivity of the Earth's different surface types helps determine the efficiency with
which the planet radiatively cools to space and is a critical variable in climate
models. However, to date, most measurements of surface emissivity have been made in the
mid-infrared. The FINESSE project is novel in employing a ground-based system capable of
extending these datasets into the far-infrared. The system is tuned in particular for
targeting ice and snow, as the response of the climate to global warming is observed to
be most rapid in Arctic regions. Far-infrared emissivity data provided by FINESSE will
inform climate modelling studies seeking to better understand this rapid change. They
will also help to validate emissivity retrievals from upcoming satellite instruments
focusing on the far-infrared which will be deployed by ESA ([FORUM]) and NASA
([PREFIRE]).

This software is currently being adapted as part of a second project &ndash; [UNIRAS]
&ndash; to deploy a modified version of the equipment on the UKâ€™s [Facility for Airborne
Atmospheric Measurements] aircraft.

## For developers

Technical documentation is available on [FINESSE's GitHub Pages site](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/FINESSE/).

This is a Python application that uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for packaging
and dependency management. It also provides [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks
for various linters and formatters and automated tests using
[pytest](https://pytest.org/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
Pre-commit hooks are automatically kept updated with a dedicated GitHub Action.

To get started:

1. [Download and install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) following the instructions for your OS.
1. Clone this repository and make it your working directory
1. Set up the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

1. Activate the virtual environment (alternatively, ensure any python-related command is preceded by `poetry run`):

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

1. Install the git hooks:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

1. Run the main app:

   ```bash
   python -m finesse
   ```

1. Run the tests:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

1. Build the user guide:

   1. Install [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)

   1. ```bash
      python docs/gen_user_guide.py
      ```
